# password-generator

# Description

The password generator uses alerts to prompt the user to answer questions like what length they want the password to be and what character types they want to include. The user must enter at least one character type to continue. If not, they will be prompted again to choose. When finished completing the prompts, the UI displays the randomly generated password based on the users criteria.
